Simplify key generation and enrollment of machine identities (also known as SSL/TLS certificates and keys) that comply with enterprise security policy by using the [Venafi Platform](https://www.venafi.com/platform/trust-protection-platform) or [Venafi as a Service](https://www.venafi.com/venaficloud).

In lieu of direct API calls, this extension takes advantage of [VCert CLI](https://github.com/Venafi/vcert).

Install from the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GregBrownstein.MachineIdentityExtension).
